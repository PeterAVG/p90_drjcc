To install the python environment, run `make dev-setup`. NOTE: poetry is used as a package manager and python 3.11 is used. I suggest installing python 3.11 with pyenv.

To run all experiments, run `python src/main.py`. In the top of the file, variables with capital letters control which experiments to run.
